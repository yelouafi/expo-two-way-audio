# Speechmatics Two Way Audio

Expo module for capturing and playing pcm audio data in react-native apps (iOS and Android).

The aim of the module is to facilitate creating real-time conversational apps. The following features are provided:

- Request audio recording permissions
- Get clean (applying Acoustic Echo Cancelling) microphone samples in PCM format (1 channel 16 bit at 16kHz)
- Play audio samples in PCM format (1 channel 16 bit at 16kHz). Playback happens trough main speaker unless external audio sources are connected.
- Provide volume level both for the input and output samples. Float between 0 and 1.
- [iOS only] Get microphone mode and prompt user to select a microphone mode.

Check out our [examples/](./examples) to see the module in action.

## Installation

```
npm i @speechmatics/expo-two-way-audio
```

## Usage

Please check out our [examples/](./examples) to get full sample code.

1. Request permissions for recording audio

    ```JSX
    import {useMicrophonePermissions} from "@speechmatics/expo-two-way-audio";

    const [micPermission, requestMicPermission] = useMicrophonePermissions();
    console.log(micPermission);
    ```
1. Initialize the module before calling any audio functionality.
    ```JSX
    useEffect(() => {
        const initializeAudio = async () => {
            await initialize();
        };
        initializeAudio();
    }, []);

    ```
1. Play audio

    > [!NOTE]
    > The sample below uses the `buffer` module:
    > `npm install buffer`

   ```JSX
    import { Buffer } from "buffer";

    // As an example, let's play pcm data hardcoded in a variable.
    // The examples/basic-usage does this. Check it out for real base64 data.
    const audioChunk = "SOME PCM DATA BASE64 ENCODED HERE"
    const buffer = Buffer.from(audioChunk, "base64");
    const pcmData = new Uint8Array(buffer);
    playPCMData(pcmData);
   ```

2. Get microphone samples

    ```JSX
    // Set up a function to deal with microphone sample events.
    // In this case just print the data in the console.
    useExpoTwoWayAudioEventListener(
        "onMicrophoneData",
        useCallback<MicrophoneDataCallback>((event) => {
            console.log(`MIC DATA: ${event.data}`);
        }, []),
    );

    // Unmute the microphone to get microphone data events
    toggleRecording(true);
    ```

## Notes

Some audio features of expo-two-way-audio like Acoustic Echo Cancelling, noise reduction or microphone modes (iOS) don't work on simulator. Run the example on a real device to test these features.

```bash
# iOS
npx expo run:ios --device --configuration Release

# Android
npx expo run:android --device --variant release
```

For Android, the following permissions are needed: `RECORD_AUDIO`, `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`. In Expo apps they can bee added in your `app.json` file:

```javascript
expo.android.permissions: ["RECORD_AUDIO", "MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"]
```
